# EPA Contract Analysis for Small, Woman-Owned, and Minority-Owned Businesses

This README provides an overview of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on EPA contracts, focusing on identifying opportunities for small, woman-owned, and minority-owned businesses. The analysis leverages a dataset of EPA contracts to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can guide businesses in navigating the government contracting landscape.
## Problem Statement: 
Task is to help small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses secure Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contract awards.
Using descriptive and diagnostic analytics, we will analyze patterns in the potential total value of awards granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


# Who are the stakeholders?
In the context of analyzing EPA contracts to aid small, woman-owned, and minority-owned businesses, the key stakeholders include:

- Small Businesses: Enterprises classified as small based on specific industry standards and criteria.
- Woman-Owned Businesses: Businesses that are at least 51% owned, controlled, and operated by one or more women.
- Minority-Owned Businesses: Businesses that are at least 51% owned, controlled, and operated by one or more individuals from a minority group.
- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): The federal agency awarding contracts, interested in diversifying its supplier base and ensuring equitable access to contracting opportunities.
- Policymakers and Regulatory Bodies: Entities that create and enforce laws and regulations affecting government contracting, aiming to foster an inclusive economy.
- Support Organizations and Advocacy Groups: Non-profits, industry associations, and other groups that support small, woman-owned, and minority-owned businesses through resources, training, and advocacy.

# What problem are we trying to solve for the stakeholders?
- The primary problem we aim to address is the limited access and unequal participation of small, woman-owned, and minority-owned businesses in EPA contracting opportunities.
- Despite the potential for these contracts to drive business growth and contribute to economic diversity, various barriers can hinder these businesses' ability to compete for and win contracts.
- Based on internet research we did, these barriers include lack of information, complexity of the contracting process, and limited resources to meet the requirements of large government contracts.

# How will we solve the problem?
To address this problem and support the stakeholders, the following strategies can be implemented based on the insights gained from the data analysis:
- Data-Driven Insights and Guidance: Provide comprehensive analysis and reports that highlight sectors, contract types, and geographical regions with the most opportunities for targeted businesses. This can inform strategic decisions and targeting efforts.
- Capacity Building Programs: Develop and offer training programs, workshops, and resources focused on navigating the government contracting process, bidding strategies, and fulfilling contract requirements, tailored to the needs of small, woman-owned, and minority-owned businesses.
- Policy Advocacy and Engagement: Use the insights from the analysis to make suggestions for how to encourage the participation of small, women-owned, and minority owned buisnesses with EPA, and ensure they get the proper funding.

## Key Insight from Data Exploration:
- Disparities in contract values.
  - Higher values for woman-owned, minority-owned, and small disadvantaged businesses.
  - Could be because EPA has departments focusing on underrepresented ssented businesses (Suggests that this does work) 
- The businesses do well on certain contract types
  - Women-owned businesses => BPA calls
- Certain Contracts value Certain Buisness Sectors
  - Top 3 buinness sectors were:
    - Roofing Contracts
    - Fabricated Metal Building and Component Manufacturing
    - Markating Research and Public Opinion Polling
- Regional Disparities:
  - Varied contract values across states.

## Recommendations:
1. Sector Focus:
   
Encourage focus on high-value sectors.

Highlight successful sectors for businesses.

Engaging in partnerships or networking within these sectors

2. Strategize their focus:
   
 Potentially targeting states with higher average values if they are equipped to handle larger projects.
 
3. Contract Type Focus:
   
Potentially target contract types that specific business would do good on.

4. Addressing Barriers:
   
Develop interventions for sector-specific barriers.

Provide specialized support for minority-owned and small disadvantaged businesses.


## Conclusion
The analysis provides a foundation for understanding the landscape of EPA contracting for small, woman-owned, and minority-owned businesses. By following the outlined strategies, businesses can navigate and leverage opportunities in government contracting more effectively.
